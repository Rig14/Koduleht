                            There once was a ship that put to sea
                            <br>
                            The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
                            <br>
                            The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
                            <br>
                            O blow, my bully boys, blow (Huh!)

                            One day, when the tonguin' is done

                            She'd not been two weeks from shore
                            <br>
                            When down on her, a right whale bore

                            The captain called all hands and swore

                            He'd take that whale in tow (Huh!)

                            Before the boat had hit the water

                            The whale's tail came up and caught her

                            All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her

                            <br>
                            No line was cut, no whale was freed
                            <br>
                            The Captain's mind was not of greed
                            <br>
                            But he belonged to the whaleman's creed

                            <br>
                            The line went slack, then tight once more
                            <br>
                            All boats were lost, there were only four
                            <br>
                            But still that whale did go (Huh!)
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            Soon may the Wellerman come
                            <br>
                            To bring us sugar and tea and rum
                            <br>
                            One day, when the tonguin' is done

                            As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
                            <br>
                            The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
                            <br>
                            The Wellerman makes his regular call
                            <br>
                            To encourage the Captain, crew, and all (Huh!)
                            <br>

                            Where are you going? Can I come too?
                            <br>
                            The whole world is open, a playground for me and you

                            <br>
                            They might tell you that I went crazy
                            <br>

                            I know we try and the days they go by
                            <br>
                            Until we get old, there's water in the flowers, let's grow
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            But it's more when I'm standing in crowds that I'm feeling the most on my own
                            <br>
                            And I know that somebody knows me, I know somewhere there's home
                            <br>
                            I'm starting to see that all I have to do is get up and go

                            I gotta get going, going, gone before I'm gone
